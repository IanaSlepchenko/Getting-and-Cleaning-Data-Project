# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
## Course Project

The data used in the project was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The source of the data can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## "run_analysis.R", its purpose and details of each step the code:  
      Each part of the code performes the following:
### 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 

### 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

### 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

### 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

### 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps of the project:

1) After uploading the data, the folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" should be used as a working directory for the project.  
2) Put run_analysis.R in the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in order to run the code.
3) Run "run_analysis.R". As a result, a new "TidyData.txt" file should be generated in the working directory.
